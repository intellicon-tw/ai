#GAM Model Level 1: Macroeconomic Determination Principles

Peiran Quantitative Insights | Risksoft Technology

1. **Bull, Bear, and Range Market Determination:**

   * **Bull Market:** Global Assets seasonal indicator is Spring, Summer, or Autumn **and** Currency/USD is Spring, Summer, or Autumn.
   * **Bear Market:** Global Assets seasonal indicator is Winter.
   * **Range Market:** Global Assets seasonal indicator is Spring, Summer, or Autumn **and** Currency/USD is Winter.

2. **A‑Share/China Market Bull/Bear Determination – Is A‑Shares Buyable?**

   * If **either** of the following conditions meets Bull Market, display Bull Market; otherwise display Bear Market:

     1. China Index “Long‑Term Momentum” > 50
     2. ChiNext Leading Indicator “Long‑Term Momentum” > 50

## Additional Notes:

1. Global asset performance drives USD direction.

2. The macroeconomic cycle lasts \~3–3.5 years: \~2–2.5 years uptrend, \~6–9 months downtrend.

3. The Semiconductor Leading Indicator can serve as a market‑fundamentals timing gauge.

4. The Tech equity market is composed of multiple semiconductor and tech indices to reduce volatility and clarify trends.

5. The Currency/USD excess rate measures currency over/underperformance vs. USD and leads equities by 3–4 months.

6. The ChiNext Leading Indicator tracks ChiNext’s excess returns vs. the SSE Composite as a forward signal for A‑share and HK markets.

7. Import/export guidance: when USD is set to appreciate, exporters may convert small amounts; importers should scale in FX purchases to mitigate risk.

8. Global assets vs. USD relationship:

   * Negative correlation: when the market weakens, USD strengthens.
   * Currency/USD excess rate correlates positively with global assets and negatively with USD.

9. Describe markets, indices, equities, ETFs, funds, assets, and excess rates as “rise, fall, or flat.”

   * E.g., TWOTCI Index +1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to rise 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to fall 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to be flat.”
   * TSMC +1% → “Forecast TSMC to rise 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TSMC to fall 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TSMC to be flat.”

10. For non‑USD currencies, describe FX Index moves as “advance, depreciate, or flat.”

    * E.g., TWD +1% → “Forecast TWD to depreciate 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TWD to advance 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TWD to be flat.”

11. Describe USD Index as “advance, depreciate, or flat.”

    * E.g., USD Index +1% → “Forecast USD Index to advance 1%”; –1% → “Forecast USD Index to depreciate 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast USD Index to be flat.”

12. Position sizing tiers: High, Medium, Low, Zero. Use Total Score 2 as the % (rounded to the nearest integer): > 60% = High; 40–59% = Medium; 10–39% = Low; < 10% = Zero.

13. Momentum metrics: Long‑term (monthly–quarterly), Mid‑term (daily–weekly), Short‑term (hourly–daily), Overall (average of the three, weekly–monthly).

14. Momentum ratings by score: > 70 = Excellent; 60–69 = Good; 50–59 = Neutral; < 50 = Deteriorating.

15. Use Global Assets Short‑Term Momentum as the benchmark: list asset classes stronger than Global Assets and those weaker.

    * E.g., among Risk Assets, USD, Energy, Agri are stronger; Bonds, Metals, Excess Rate, Bitcoin, Tech Equities are weaker.

16. For the ChiNext Leading Indicator (code = SZ399006 Index–SH000905 Index), display its Chinese name only.

17. Present each narrative section as bullet points.

18. Mapping: DXY Curncy = Risk‑Free Asset; AllAssets Index = Risk Asset.

## Asset Class Analysis Report Generation Logic

**Subject:** {Asset Class Name}

Updated Date: {2/12/2025}

1. **Investment Recommendation**

   1. Look up this asset’s mapping\_table, use Total Score 2 for position sizing, forecast change, and target price.
   2. Retrieve this asset’s long‑term, mid‑term, short‑term momentum, and overall momentum.

2. **Fundamental Analysis**

   1. Retrieve this asset’s correlation with indices and relative volatility.
   2. Retrieve this asset’s 6‑year annualized return, maximum drawdown, and risk‑return ratio.

3. **Trend Analysis**

   1. Check short‑term momentum vs. last week (T–5): improvement or deterioration, indicate short‑term risk.
   2. Check mid‑term momentum vs. last week: improvement or deterioration, recommend hold/add/reduce.
   3. Check long‑term momentum vs. last week: improvement or deterioration, recommend long‑term hold/add/reduce.
   4. Check overall momentum vs. last week: improvement or deterioration, indicate short‑term risk.
   5. Note forecast change, target price, Total Score 2 position, and trading rating.
