Updated Date: mm/dd/yyyy

1. **Bull, Bear, and Range Market Determination:**

   * **Bull Market:** Global Assets seasonal quadrant is Spring, Summer, or Autumn **and** Currency/USD seasonal quadrant is Spring, Summer, or Autumn.
   * **Bear Market:** Global Assets seasonal quadrant is Winter.
   * **Range Market:** Global Assets seasonal quadrant is Spring, Summer, or Autumn **and** Currency/USD seasonal quadrant is Winter.

2. **A‑Share/China Market Bull/Bear Determination – Can A‑Shares be Bought?**

   * If **either** of the following meets Bull Market criteria, display Bull Market; otherwise display Bear Market:

     1. China Index “Long‑Term Momentum” > 50
     2. ChiNext Leading Indicator “Long‑Term Momentum” > 50

## Additional Notes:

* Global asset moves drive USD direction.
* The macrocycle spans approx. 3–3.5 years: \~2–2.5 years uptrend; \~6–9 months downtrend.
* The Semiconductor Leading Indicator can time market fundamentals.
* The Tech equity market is built from multiple semiconductor & tech indices to reduce volatility and clarify trend.
* The Currency/USD excess rate measures currency over/underperformance vs. USD and leads equities by 3–4 months.
* The ChiNext Leading Indicator tracks ChiNext’s excess returns vs. the SSE Composite as a lead signal for A‑share/HK markets.
* Importers should scale in FX purchases when USD is set to appreciate; exporters may convert small amounts to hedge.
* **Global assets vs. USD relationship:**

  * Negative correlation: market weakness → USD strength
  * Currency/USD excess rate: positive vs. global assets; negative vs. USD
* Describe markets, indices, equities, ETFs, funds, assets, and excess rates as “rise, fall, or flat.”
* For non‑USD currencies, describe FX Index moves as “advance, depreciate, or flat.”
* Describe USD Index as “advance, depreciate, or flat.”
* Position tiers: High (> 60%), Medium (40–59%), Low (10–39%), Zero (< 10%) based on Total Score 2 percentage (rounded).
* Momentum metrics: Long‑term (monthly–quarterly), Mid‑term (daily–weekly), Short‑term (hourly–daily), Overall (average, weekly–monthly).
* Momentum rating by score: > 70 = Excellent; 60–69 = Good; 50–59 = Neutral; < 50 = Deteriorating.
* Use Global Assets short‑term momentum as benchmark: list asset classes stronger or weaker than Global Assets.
* ChiNext Leading Indicator (code “SZ399006 Index–SH000905 Index”) denotes A‑share cycles—display Chinese name only.
* Present each section as bullet points.
* **Mapping:** DXY Curncy = Risk‑Free Asset; AllAssets Index = Risk Asset.
