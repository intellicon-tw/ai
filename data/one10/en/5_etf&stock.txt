# GAM Model Level 1: Macroeconomic Determination Principles

Peiran Quantitative Insights | Risksoft Technology

1. **Bull, Bear, and Range Market Determination:**

   * **Bull Market:** Global Assets seasonal quadrant is Spring, Summer, or Autumn.
   * **Bear Market:** Global Assets seasonal quadrant is Winter.
   * **Range Market:** Global Assets seasonal quadrant is Spring, Summer, or Autumn, **and** Currency/USD seasonal quadrant is Winter.

2. **A‑Share/China Market Bull/Bear Determination – Is A‑Share Buyable?**

   * If **either** of the following conditions is met, display Bull Market; otherwise display Bear Market:

     1. China Index “Long‑Term Momentum” > 50
     2. ChiNext Leading Indicator “Long‑Term Momentum” > 50

## Supplementary Notes

1. Global asset returns drive USD moves.
2. The macro cycle runs \~3–3.5 years: \~2–2.5 years uptrend, \~6–9 months downtrend. The bull phase that began in Q1 2023 is projected to peak in Q1 2025, currently in its late stage.
3. The Semiconductor Leading Indicator can time market fundamentals.
4. The Tech equity market is a composite of multiple semiconductor and tech indices to reduce volatility and clarify trend.
5. The Currency/USD excess rate measures FX over/underperformance vs. USD and leads equities by 3–4 months.
6. The ChiNext Leading Indicator compares ChiNext returns to the SSE Composite as a forward signal for A‑share and HK markets.
7. Import/export guidance: when USD is forecast to appreciate, exporters may convert small amounts; importers should scale in FX purchases to reduce risk.
8. **Global assets vs. USD relationship:**

   * Negative correlation: weakening markets → USD strength.
   * Currency/USD excess rate: positive vs. global assets; negative vs. USD.
9. Describe markets, indices, equities, ETFs, funds, assets, and excess rates as “rise, fall, or flat.”

   * E.g., TWOTCI Index +1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to rise 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to fall 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to be flat.”
   * TSMC +1% → “Forecast TSMC to rise 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TSMC to fall 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TSMC to be flat.”
10. Describe non‑USD currency indices as “advance, depreciate, or flat.”

    * E.g., TWD +1% → “Forecast TWD to depreciate 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TWD to advance 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TWD to be flat.”
11. Describe USD Index as “advance, depreciate, or flat.”

    * E.g., USD Index +1% → “Forecast USD Index to advance 1%”; –1% → “Forecast USD Index to depreciate 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast USD Index to be flat.”
12. Position tiers: High (> 60%), Medium (40–59%), Low (10–39%), Zero (< 10%), based on Total Score 2 percentage (rounded).
13. Momentum metrics: Long‑term (monthly–quarterly), Mid‑term (daily–weekly), Short‑term (hourly–daily), Overall (average of the three, weekly–monthly).
14. Momentum rating: > 70 = Excellent; 60–69 = Good; 50–59 = Neutral; < 50 = Deteriorating.
15. Allocate assets equally (1:1:1) across the three with highest short‑term momentum—for example: USD, Tech Equities, Bitcoin.
16. Using Global Assets short‑term momentum as benchmark, list asset classes stronger vs. weaker than Global Assets—for instance: among Risk Assets, USD, Energy, and Agri outperform; Bonds, Metals, Excess Rate, Bitcoin, and Tech Equities underperform.
17. Trade signals reference “Date (Most Recent Signal)”: “Recent Signal: 1” = buy; “Recent Signal: 2” = sell; “Current Signal: 1” = momentum strengthening.
18. ChiNext Leading Indicator (code = SZ399006 Index–SH000905 Index) denotes A‑share cycles—display Chinese name only.
