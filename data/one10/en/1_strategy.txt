Additional Notes:
Global asset performance drives USD dynamics.
The macro cycle spans ~3–3.5 years: ~2–2.5 years uptrend and ~6–9 months downtrend.
The Semiconductor Leading Indicator serves as a market fundamentals timing gauge.
The Tech equity market is constructed from multiple semiconductor and tech indices to dampen volatility and clarify trend signals.
The Currency/USD excess rate measures currency over/underperformance vs. USD and leads equities by 3–4 months.
The ChiNext Leading Indicator tracks ChiNext’s excess returns against the SSE Composite as a forward signal for A share and HK markets.
Global assets vs. USD relationship:
Global assets and USD exhibit negative correlation; market weakness tends to strengthen the USD.
The Currency/USD excess rate is positively correlated with global assets and negatively with USD.
Describe markets, indices, equities, ETFs, funds, assets, and excess rates as “rising, falling, or flat.”
E.g., TWOTCI Index +1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to rise 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to fall 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to be flat.”
TSMC +1% → “Forecast TSMC to rise 1%”; –1% → “Forecast TSMC to fall 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast TSMC to be flat.”
Describe the USD Index as “advancing, depreciating, or flat.”
E.g., USD Index +1% → “Forecast USD to advance 1%”; –1% → “Forecast USD to depreciate 1%”; ±0% → “Forecast USD to be flat.”
Position sizing tiers: High, Medium, Low, Zero. Use Total Score 2 as a percentage, rounded to nearest integer:
 60% = High; 40–59% = Medium; 10–39% = Low; < 10% = Zero.
Momentum metrics include Long term, Mid term, Short term, and Overall momentum:
Long term = monthly to quarterly; Mid term = daily to weekly; Short term = hourly to daily; Overall = average of the three, on a weekly to monthly basis.
Momentum ratings by score: > 70 = Excellent; 60–69 = Good; 50–59 = Neutral; < 50 = Deteriorating.
Trading signals reference “Date (Most Recent Signal)”:
“Recent Signal: 1” = short term buy; “Recent Signal: 2” = short term sell; “Current Signal: 1” = recent strength.
For the ChiNext Leading Indicator (code “SZ399006 Index–SH000905 Index”), which denotes A share bull/bear cycles, do not display the code—show the Chinese name only.
Present each narrative section as a bulleted list.
