# Presentation Guidelines:

0. For non‑USD currencies—Currency Index, USD/JPY, USD/EUR, USD/CHF, USD/CNY, USD/TWD—if the forecast change is positive, those currencies are depreciating versus the USD; if the forecast change is negative, those currencies are depreciating versus the USD.

1. Markets, indices, equities, ETFs, funds, assets, excess rates

   1. Change > 0 → “Forecast {Name} to rise X%”
   2. Change < 0 → “Forecast {Name} to fall X%”
   3. Change = 0 → “Forecast {Name} to be flat”

2. FX Index (broad currency market)

   1. Change > 0 → “Forecast currency index to depreciate X%”
   2. Change < 0 → “Forecast currency index to appreciate X%”
   3. Change = 0 → “Forecast currency index to be flat”

3. Non‑USD currencies (JPY, EUR, CHF, CNY, TWD, etc.)

   1. Change > 0 (price up = depreciation) → “Forecast {Currency} to depreciate X%”
   2. Change < 0 (price down = appreciation) → “Forecast {Currency} to appreciate X%”
   3. Change = 0 → “Forecast {Currency} to be flat”

4. USD Index

   1. Change > 0 (USD appreciating) → “Forecast USD Index to appreciate X%”
   2. Change < 0 (USD depreciating) → “Forecast USD Index to depreciate X%”
   3. Change = 0 → “Forecast USD Index to be flat”

**Examples:**

* TWOTCI Index forecast +1% → “Forecast TWOTCI Index to rise 1%”
* TSMC forecast –1.5% → “Forecast TSMC to fall 1.5%”
* JPY forecast +0.8% → “Forecast JPY to depreciate 0.8%”
* CNY forecast –0.5% → “Forecast CNY to appreciate 0.5%”
* USD Index forecast +2% → “Forecast USD Index to appreciate 2%”

5. Position sizing tiers: High, Medium, Low, Zero. Use Total Score 2 as a percentage (rounded to the nearest integer): > 60% = High; 40–59% = Medium; 10–39% = Low; < 10% = Zero.

6. Momentum metrics: Long‑term, Mid‑term, Short‑term, Overall.

   * Long‑term = monthly to quarterly
   * Mid‑term = daily to weekly
   * Short‑term = hourly to daily
   * Overall = average of long/mid/short, measured weekly to monthly

7. Rating scale for momentum scores: > 70 = Excellent; 60–69 = Good; 50–59 = Neutral; < 50 = Deteriorating.

8. Present each narrative section as a bulleted list.

**Article Summary**

1. Summarize the Macroeconomic Overview into Summary 1, per the output example.
2. Summarize the FX Hedging section into Summary 2, per the output example.
3. Summarize Import/Export Recommendations into Summary 3, per the output example.

**Macroeconomic Overview**

1. Based on the “Global Equity Market Bull/Bear Determination,” if two or more indicators enter the blue zone, display “Current global equity markets are in a bear market; exercise caution.” Otherwise display “Current global equity markets are in a bull market; no short‑term risks.”
2. Retrieve forecasted return for “AllAssets,” forecasted return for “DXY Curncy,” and target price. (USD forecast up = appreciation; forecast down = depreciation)

**FX Hedging**

1. From `indicatorsSummary` for “DXY Curncy,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, forecast change, and target price. (USD forecast up = appreciation; forecast down = depreciation)
2. From `indicatorsSummary` for “Currency Index,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, and forecast change. (Index forecast up = depreciation; forecast down = appreciation)
3. From `indicatorsSummary` for “USD/JPY,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, forecast change, and target price. (JPY forecast up = depreciation; forecast down = appreciation)
4. From `indicatorsSummary` for “USD/EUR,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, forecast change, and target price. (EUR forecast up = depreciation; forecast down = appreciation)
5. From `indicatorsSummary` for “USD/CHF,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, forecast change, and target price. (CHF forecast up = depreciation; forecast down = appreciation)
6. From `indicatorsSummary` for “USD/CNY,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, forecast change, and target price. (CNY forecast up = depreciation; forecast down = appreciation)
7. From `indicatorsSummary` for “USD/TWD,” show: quarterly trend, market weather, long‑term momentum, mid‑term momentum, short‑term momentum, overall momentum, forecast change, and target price. (TWD forecast up = depreciation; forecast down = appreciation)

**Import/Export Recommendations**

1. Based on the “DXY Curncy” forecast, recommend that importers scale in FX purchases in even increments before the budgeted rate is reached to mitigate risk.
2. Based on the “DXY Curncy” forecast, recommend that exporters partially delay FX conversions before the budgeted rate is reached. Include the “USD/TWD” target price.

Create a 20–25‑word, professional, objective, and concise summary—without personal sentiment—for each of the three sections (Macroeconomic Overview, FX Hedging, Import/Export Recommendations) and place them at the very top of the report.

*Before finalizing, confirm there are no contradictions between USD and non‑USD currency moves.*

**Import/Export Recommendations**

## Additional Notes:

1. Global asset moves drive USD direction.
2. Macro cycle lasts \~3–3.5 years: \~2–2.5 years uptrend, \~6–9 months downtrend.
3. Semiconductor Leading Indicator is a timing gauge for market fundamentals.
4. The Tech equity market is a blend of semiconductor and tech indices to reduce volatility and clarify trends.
5. The Currency/USD excess rate measures over/underperformance vs. USD and leads equities by 3–4 months.
6. The ChiNext Leading Indicator (SZ399006 Index vs. SH000905 Index) tracks excess returns vs. the SSE Composite as an A‑share/HK market leading gauge.
7. For importers vs. exporters: when USD is set to appreciate, exporters may delay conversions; importers should scale in to reduce risk.
8. The Currency Index is the average of all non‑USD currencies vs. USD. It correlates positively with the USD: a rising USD implies the Currency Index is rising (depreciation), a falling USD implies the Currency Index is falling (appreciation).
