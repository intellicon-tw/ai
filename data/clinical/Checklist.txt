Checklist of additional documents and data required for CER
Below is a recommended checklist of additional documents and data that typically should be included in a robust Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) for a medical device such as a wearable surgical lighting system. These items would help substantiate claims of safety and clinical performance with more concrete evidence.
 
1. Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP)
•	Structured Search Strategy: Outline the literature search methodology (databases, search terms, inclusion/exclusion criteria), the rationale for the timeframe covered, and the approach to screen relevant articles.
•	Appraisal Criteria: Present a plan describing how the quality and relevance of each piece of clinical data or publication will be assessed (e.g., using recognized appraisal tools).
•	Data Analysis Framework: Define how data on safety, performance, and benefit/risk will be collated and interpreted.
 
2. Detailed Literature Review and Appraisal
•	Systematic Literature Search Results:
o	Provide actual search strings, databases used (e.g., PubMed, Embase), search periods, and a flowchart of screened, included, and excluded references.
o	Summaries of each included study: number of subjects, study type, measured outcomes, and relevance to the device’s intended use.
•	Critical Appraisal of Studies:
o	Assess the level of evidence, study quality, and direct applicability to the subject device (especially if only indirect or similar products were studied).
o	Clear justification for excluding or including each study.
 
3. Post-Market Surveillance(PMS) / Real-World Data
•	Complaint & Vigilance Records:
o	Summaries of any complaints, device malfunctions, or user feedback received since the product launch.
o	Information on how many devices have been distributed/used and in what clinical settings.
•	Adverse Event / FSCA Review:
o	Documentation showing searches of official databases for Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCA), recalls, or adverse events related to this or equivalent products.
o	If no events occurred, confirm that the search was performed and specify the databases and time period.
•	Trending Analysis:
o	If there are minor complaints, group them by failure mode or root cause.
o	Demonstrate any corrective or preventive actions taken.
 
4. Comparative or Equivalence Data (If Applicable)
•	Equivalence Justification Table:
o	A line-by-line comparison to a predicate or equivalent device, covering design, technology, clinical indications, performance characteristics, materials, etc.
o	References to published data (clinical studies, regulatory filings, or public reports) supporting the claimed equivalence.
o	Explanation of any differences and their clinical impact (or lack thereof).
 
5. Additional Performance and Safety Evidence
•	Pre-Clinical / Bench Test Reports:
o	More detailed results, protocols, acceptance criteria, and outcomes from laboratory or simulated-use testing (e.g., measuring real-world illuminance under typical ambient lighting conditions, verifying heat-dissipation and battery performance at various usage intervals).
•	Clinical or Usability Studies (if performed):
o	If any formal clinical evaluation or usability study was conducted (even a small pilot or observational study), provide protocols, number of participants, setting, key findings on safety or performance, and any user satisfaction or comfort metrics.
 
6. Risk Management Documentation
•	ISO 14971-Compliant Risk Management File:
o	A summary linking each identified risk to its mitigating measures and residual risk evaluation.
o	The actual risk assessment for key hazard categories (e.g., optical safety, thermal effects, battery issues).
o	Explanation of how post-market feedback influences ongoing risk analysis.
 
7. Benefit/Risk Analysis
•	Quantitative or Semi-Quantitative Assessment:
o	Where possible, include numerical data or structured analysis (e.g., probability and severity scoring).
o	Demonstrate how the device’s clinical benefit (improved visualization, portability, etc.) outweighs the residual risks (battery overheating, user error, bright-light hazards) and why any potential side effects or hazards remain acceptable.
 
8. Summary of Findings and Justifications
•	Integrated Conclusion:
o	Consolidate the above data into a coherent statement on how it supports the device’s claim of safety and performance under the intended use.
o	Highlight any open questions or uncertainties needing post-market follow-up or additional testing.
 
9. Plans for Ongoing Clinical Evidence (If Required by Regulations)
•	Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) Plan:
o	If applicable, describe the ongoing or planned PMCF activities to fill evidence gaps.
o	Indicate how user feedback, real-world usage data, or additional clinical studies will be collected and analyzed.
 
Why These Items Are Needed
1.	Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) & Systematic Literature Review: Ensures transparent and reproducible methods in gathering and assessing the evidence.
2.	Detailed PMS Data: Demonstrates real-world safety profile and performance in actual clinical use.
3.	Equivalence Analysis: Validates how known data from a comparable device can be legitimately applied to your device.
4.	Additional Pre-Clinical & Clinical Performance Data: Fills gaps in verifying the performance claims under representative conditions.
5.	Risk Management Summary: Confirms that all foreseeable risks have been identified and mitigated to acceptable levels, aligning with ISO 14971.
6.	Benefit/Risk Analysis: Provides a structured argument that residual risks are outweighed by clinical benefits.
Completing this documentation will substantiate the clinical evidence more robustly, thus reinforcing the conclusions on safety and performance in the Clinical Evaluation Report.
