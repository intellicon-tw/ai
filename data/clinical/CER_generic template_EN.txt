1. Summary
Purpose:
•	Provide a concise overview of the clinical evaluation outcome.
•	Highlight key findings regarding device safety, performance, and benefit-risk.
Example Text:
1. Summary
This Clinical Evaluation Report summarizes the evidence supporting the safety and performance of the [Device Name]. Based on the literature review, in-house test results, and post-market data, the device demonstrates acceptable clinical benefits and manageable risks for its intended purpose.
 
2. Scope of the Clinical Evaluation
2.1 Purpose, Intended Use, and Use Environment
Purpose:
•	Reiterate the device’s intended clinical applications, target population, and usage setting.
Example Text:
2.1 Purpose, Intended Use, and Use Environment
The [Device Name] is intended to [state intended function, e.g., assist muscle rehabilitation]. It is designed for adult patients requiring [describe condition], and is primarily used in [clinical environment]. This CER consolidates all relevant data to confirm safe use under these circumstances.
2.2 Device Description
Purpose:
•	Provide a brief technical overview (refer to CEP or technical documentation if more detail is needed).
Example Text:
2.2 Device Description
The system includes [components]. Key specifications (e.g., power, dimensions, safety features) are provided in the device’s technical file [Doc. Ref.], ensuring compliance with applicable standards (e.g., IEC 60601-1).
2.3 Objective of the Clinical Evaluation
Purpose:
•	Outline the questions or hypotheses the CER aims to address (e.g., verifying specific performance claims, risk factors).
Example Text:
2.3 Objective of the Clinical Evaluation
The primary objective is to verify whether the device meets clinical performance targets (e.g., improved functionality) and adheres to safety requirements, thus supporting any regulatory submissions or internal quality standards.
 
3. Clinical Background, Current Knowledge, and State of the Art
Purpose:
•	Summarize the medical context in which the device will be used.
•	Explain how the device compares to existing solutions or similar technologies.
Example Text:
3. Clinical Background and State of the Art
[Describe the condition or procedure] is commonly addressed by [traditional methods or alternative therapies]. Recently, devices offering [key technology improvement] have shown promise in enhancing patient outcomes. The [Device Name] aims to align with this state of the art by providing a safe, user-friendly solution.
 
4. Device Under Evaluation
4.1 Type of Evaluation
Purpose:
•	Clarify the approach used: literature-based, clinical investigations, post-market data, or an equivalence argument.
Example Text:
4.1 Type of Evaluation
This CER adopts a hybrid approach, combining existing literature on similar devices, internal bench-testing results, and real-world feedback. Where appropriate, equivalence with a legally marketed device is asserted based on matching intended use and technical characteristics.
4.2 Manufacturer’s Data
Purpose:
•	Summarize in-house tests or clinical investigations.
•	Reference test reports, risk management documents, or pilot studies.
Example Text:
4.2 Manufacturer’s Data
Comprehensive bench testing (electrical safety, mechanical endurance, and software validation) confirms the device’s adherence to design specifications. A small observational study (n=15) indicated positive user feedback and no adverse events. Risk controls identified in the ISO 14971 Risk Management File [File Ref.] further reduce any potential hazards.
4.3 Post-Market Surveillance (PMS/PMCF) Data
Purpose:
•	Include complaint data, adverse event reports, or any post-market clinical follow-up (if the device is already on the market).
Example Text:
4.3 Post-Market Data
Since initial market release, no serious adverse events have been reported. Minor complaints largely relate to wear-and-tear of consumable parts. A PMCF plan (Plan Ref. No.) is being executed to track long-term safety and performance outcomes, with interim results expected in six months.
 
5. Clinical Data from Literature
5.1 Literature Search Protocol
Purpose:
•	Summarize how the literature search was performed (databases, timeframe, keywords).
Example Text:
5.1 Literature Search Protocol
Following the CEP guidelines, we performed a systematic search in PubMed and Embase from 2010–2023, focusing on [keywords and operators]. The inclusion criteria targeted human clinical trials or observational studies assessing devices with comparable technologies.
5.2 Results & Selection
Purpose:
•	Provide the number of articles found, screening process, final included studies, possibly with a PRISMA flow diagram.
Example Text:
5.2 Results & Selection
Out of 250 initial records, 48 full-text articles were screened; 12 met the inclusion criteria. Five articles detailed comparable devices and reported improvements in [clinical outcomes]. Seven articles discussed safety profiles, with minimal adverse events recorded.
5.3 Appraisal & Summary
Purpose:
•	Discuss the quality and relevance of the final included articles.
•	Highlight any consistent findings or conflicting evidence.
Example Text:
5.3 Appraisal & Summary
Among the 12 included studies, most used robust methodologies (randomized controlled trials or prospective designs). The reported outcomes strongly suggest that devices employing similar technology provide measurable clinical benefits, including enhanced patient compliance. Adverse events were rare and generally non-serious (e.g., minor skin irritation).
 
6. Risk/Benefit Analysis
Purpose:
•	Integrate risk management findings with the clinical evidence.
•	Determine if the residual risk is acceptable in light of demonstrated clinical benefits.
Example Text:
6. Risk/Benefit Analysis
Key risks identified (e.g., improper electrode placement, over-stimulation) appear effectively mitigated through device design and user training. In contrast, the documented benefits—improved treatment adherence and functional recovery—significantly outweigh these manageable risks. Overall, the benefit/risk balance remains favorable.
 
7. Conclusion and Recommendations
Purpose:
•	Provide an overall conclusion on device safety and performance.
•	Indicate next steps (e.g., PMCF, further testing, or readiness for regulatory submission).
Example Text:
7. Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the aggregated clinical evidence, the [Device Name] meets the necessary requirements for safety and performance. It is recommended to proceed with regulatory submission under [pathway, e.g., 510(k) or CE marking]. Additional PMCF activities are advised to capture extended real-world outcomes and confirm long-term device reliability.
 
8. Date of Next Clinical Evaluation
Purpose:
•	State when the CER will be updated or revisited.
•	Align with internal quality procedures or regulatory guidelines.
Example Text:
8. Date of Next Clinical Evaluation
This report will be reviewed 12 months from its publication date, or earlier if significant design changes occur or new clinical evidence emerges. Any major updates will be documented in subsequent report versions.
 
9. References
Purpose:
•	List all referenced literature, standards, technical files, and regulatory documents.
Example Text:
9. References

Final Note
The Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) — is intended to serve as high-level frameworks. You should tailor them according to your device’s risk classification, regulatory pathway (e.g., EU MDR, FDA 510(k), etc.), the results of your risk management process, and any specific local or organizational documentation requirements.
