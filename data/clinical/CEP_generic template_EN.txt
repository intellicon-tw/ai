Below is a generic template in English for creating a Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP). It provides a standard structure along with guidance on what information to include in each section. Adapt them as needed to align with your specific device characteristics, regulatory requirements, and internal procedures.

1. Introduction
Purpose:
•	Briefly explain why this Clinical Evaluation Plan is needed.
•	Refer to relevant regulations or standards (e.g., EU MDR, MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4, ISO 14971, FDA Guidance).
•	State the main objectives of the plan (e.g., demonstrating safety and performance of the device through clinical evidence).
Example Text:
1. Introduction
This Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) outlines the systematic approach to gather, appraise, and analyze clinical data for the [Device Name]. It ensures alignment with pertinent regulations (e.g., MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4) to demonstrate the device’s safety and performance under its intended conditions of use.
 
2. Scope of the Evaluation
Purpose:
•	Define the device’s intended purpose, target users, and clinical application environments.
•	Identify the regulatory classification or pathway and clarify what clinical claims will be supported by this evaluation.
Example Text:
2. Scope of the Evaluation
The [Device Name] is intended for [describe intended use, target population, clinical setting]. This CEP focuses on establishing clinical evidence to support the device’s safety, efficacy, and any relevant performance claims. The device falls under [regulatory classification, e.g., Class IIa under the EU MDR], which requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation in accordance with applicable regulations.
 
3. Device Description
Purpose:
•	Summarize the device’s design, principle of operation, key technical specifications, and unique features.
•	Reference the risk management process where appropriate (ISO 14971).
Example Text:
3. Device Description
The [Device Name] is a [type of device] designed to [briefly describe main function]. It consists of [list components: e.g., main control unit, sensors, electrodes], powered by [power source/battery], with adjustable parameters for [describe adjustable features]. Technical details, such as operating ranges and safety features, are documented in the device’s technical file.
 
4. Methodology for Clinical Evaluation
4.1 Sources of Data
Purpose:
•	List all the data sources you plan to use (literature, in-house testing, post-market surveillance, clinical investigations, equivalence comparisons, etc.).
Example Text:
4.1 Sources of Data
•	Published Literature: Peer-reviewed articles on similar or equivalent devices.
•	Preclinical and Bench-Testing Reports: Internal validations (electrical safety, performance, usability).
•	Post-Market Data: Existing complaint records or adverse event reports (if any).
•	Clinical Investigation Data: Results from any ongoing or completed clinical studies.
•	Equivalence Claims: Information on devices with the same intended use and similar technological characteristics.
4.2 Literature Search Strategy
Purpose:
•	Describe the literature search plan: databases, keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria, timeframe, and language filters.
Example Text:
4.2 Literature Search Strategy
We will conduct a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from [start year] to [end year]. The search will incorporate keywords and Boolean operators relevant to [device function or therapy domain]. Studies will be screened based on predefined inclusion criteria (e.g., clinical relevance, human subjects, English language) and exclusion criteria (e.g., animal research, incomplete data).
4.3 Appraisal and Analysis
Purpose:
•	Clarify how you will evaluate the quality and relevance of each data source and how you plan to synthesize the findings.
Example Text:
4.3 Appraisal and Analysis
Each included study will undergo a structured quality assessment (e.g., levels of evidence, risk-of-bias tools). Data on safety endpoints, performance measures, and clinical outcomes will be extracted and systematically compared to the device’s risk profile and intended use. A benefit-risk summary will be generated to identify potential data gaps.
 
5. Risk Management Considerations
Purpose:
•	Show how the clinical evaluation will address or corroborate the main clinical risks identified in the Risk Management File.
•	Confirm whether additional data are needed to mitigate or clarify certain risks.
Example Text:
5. Risk Management Considerations
In accordance with ISO 14971, major clinical risks for the [Device Name] include [e.g., skin irritation, tissue damage, device malfunction]. This CEP ensures these risks are evaluated by referencing the available scientific literature, in-house test data, and user feedback. Any residual risk will be reassessed if new evidence suggests further mitigation is necessary.
 
6. Identifying Evidence Gaps & Additional Data
Purpose:
•	Outline any known or potential shortfalls in existing data.
•	Propose supplementary testing, PMCF (Post-Market Clinical Follow-up), or further clinical studies if needed.
Example Text:
6. Identifying Evidence Gaps & Additional Data
Preliminary review indicates limited data on long-term device durability in the target population. A small-scale clinical study may be planned to assess functionality over 12 months. Additionally, post-market surveillance will be used to gather further safety information from real-world usage.
 
7. Summary of Evaluation & Reporting
Purpose:
•	State the final output of this CEP: typically a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) that will compile all the findings.
•	Confirm any timelines or key milestones.
Example Text:
7. Summary of Evaluation & Reporting
The final deliverable of this plan will be a Clinical Evaluation Report integrating the results of literature search, risk analysis, and internal testing. The CER is expected to be completed by [target date], after which it will be reviewed for regulatory submission or internal quality requirements.
 
8. CEP Review & Updates
Purpose:
•	Define how often the CEP is reviewed or updated (e.g., annually or after major design changes).
•	State who is responsible for document control.
Example Text:
8. CEP Review & Updates
This CEP will be reviewed annually or upon significant modifications to the device’s design or intended use. Any updates will be documented under version control, with the Regulatory Affairs department overseeing the revision process.
 
9. References
Purpose:
•	List the regulatory documents, standards, and any background references used while developing this CEP.
Example Text:
9. References
1.	MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4, Clinical Evaluation: A Guide for Manufacturers and Notified Bodies.
2.	ISO 14971:2019, Medical Devices - Application of Risk Management.
3.	Internal Test Report [Report ID].

Final Note
The Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) — is intended to serve as high-level frameworks. You should tailor them according to your device’s risk classification, regulatory pathway (e.g., EU MDR, FDA 510(k), etc.), the results of your risk management process, and any specific local or organizational documentation requirements.
